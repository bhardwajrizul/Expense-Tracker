## üìã Differences

| Feature/Property             | useState                                    | useReducer + Context                  | Redux                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **State Management Scope**   | Component-specific                          | App-wide (Global)                     | App-wide (Global)           |
| **Middleware Support**      | No                                          | No                                   | Yes                         |
| **Devtools**                | No                                          | Limited                               | Comprehensive               |
| **Complexity**              | Low                                         | Medium                                | High                        |
| **Performance Scalability** | Optimal for small-scale apps                | Better scalability than useState      | Optimized for large apps    |
| **Setup Ease**              | Simple, built-in hooks                      | Requires context setup                | Requires redux & middleware |
| **Immutable State**         | Manual immutability practices required      | Manual immutability practices required| Handled via immer in toolkit|

## üîç Deep Dive

### `useState`
- **Definition:** React's built-in hook to manage local state within a component.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```javascript
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

### `useReducer + Context` (Redux-lite)
- **Definition:** A combination of `useReducer` to manage state logic and `Context` for global state distribution.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```javascript
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    <YourContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
        {children}
    </YourContext.Provider>
    ```

### `Redux`
- **Definition:** A predictable state container designed to help write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```javascript
    const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(...middleware));
    <Provider store={store}>
        {children}
    </Provider>
    ```
